            Prince TATA from Planet BT, who had been traveling with VAN, 
            crashed on Earth. In order to spread love, TATA decides to become star. 
            Finally, they have met six fascinating members: KOYA, RJ, SHOOKY, MANG, CHIMMY, and COOKY to make ‘BT21’, 
            and they are dreaming of becoming the most famous star in the universe, 
            THE UNIVERSTAR! Will BT21 become UNIVERSTAR, and spread love around?
            <br>Exceptionally bright and talented KOYA. Sleeping cutie full of thoughts and thoughts of sleeping. 
            RJ loves to both cook and eat. RJ's fluffy fur and warm heart makes everyone feel they're at home. 
            Tiny SHOOKY loves jokes, especially ones on friends. Milk is what SHOOKY hates the most. 
            When dancing, MANG is cooler than ever. Veiled under mask, MANG's true identity remains a secret. 
            CHIMMY enjoys wearing a yellow hoodie, and is born with a passion to work hard on everything, no matter what. 
            Prince TATA from planet BT, has a super stretchy body as well as super natural powers.
